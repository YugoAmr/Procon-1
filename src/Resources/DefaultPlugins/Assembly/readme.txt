To add your plugin dependencies for compilation and loading, you need:
- for standard .net assemblies, such as "System.Xml.Linq", you need to create a file with the name of the plugin class and the extension ".cfg", and add the line "procon.private.plugin.assembly System.Xml.Linq" ;
- for non-standard ones, copy the assemblies files to a directory with a name that match with the name of the main class of your plug-in (for example :. \ Plugins \ Assembly \ CChatGUIDStatsLogger \ MySql.Data.dll).
